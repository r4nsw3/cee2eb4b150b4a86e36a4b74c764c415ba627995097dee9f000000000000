  |   Soul Searching is a narrative survival game where you control a       |
  |   lone traveler who sails from homeland to an endless sea. On the       |
  |   way, you'll visit different islands, discover stories of their        |
  |   people, and learn about souls and dragons.                            |
  |                                                                         |
  |   At its core, this title is all about surviving in a hostile world     |
  |   as a peaceful traveler. You must deal with hunger, thirst, and        |
  |   energy. You can fish, customize your boats and even cast magic        |
  |   spells. There is no one single correct way to play. Discover every    |
  |   mystery of this world on your own. You might get lost, but it won't   |
  |   take too long to find your way in the end.                            |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Outside the gameplay, the main goal is to think about your life.      |
  |   Soul Searching conveys feelings that rarely appear in games. It       |
  |   deals with themes like growing up, isolation, search for meaning,     |
  |   and direction. It's a personal expedition deep into your soul.        |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Outside the main story, you can try a multiplayer in the random       |
  |   mode where up to 4 players work together on generated maps. More      |
  |   players mean more resources needed to survive - cooperation is        |
  |   vital. Also, there are seven other short stories that experiment      |
  |   with different ideas about gameplay and storytelling. Be sure to      |
  |   check them out; you may find them exciting and innovative.            |
